## Project Description
My second milestone project (Arrow Dash) focuses on developing my own version of the popular game Simon.

Simon is a memory game that requires the user to repeat a sequence let off by a device. The sequence features a series of 
tones and sounds that get longer each time the user succeeds in matching the sequence. 

Arrow Dash puts its own original spin on this game by trying to confuse the user as they are trying to complete the sequence. 

In this game, the user must follow the correct pattern through audio directions. The user has five options: Up, down, 
left, right, and buzz. 

While the user is given directions about the next sequence, a random button will also be pressed when the audio plays 
to try and confuse them.
